Explanation:
 * Shebang: #!/bin/bash specifies the script should be executed with Bash.
 * Service Names Array: service_names=("service1" "service2" ...) defines an array containing the service names you want to use for replacement.  Add or modify the names within the parentheses as needed.
 * YAML File Variable: yaml_file="a.yaml" stores the name of the YAML file you want to modify. Change this if your file has a different name.
 * Loop: for service_name in "${service_names[@]}"; do ... done iterates through each element in the service_names array.
 * sed Command:
   * sed -i "s/<service-name>/$service_name/g" "$yaml_file" performs the replacement.
   * -i tells sed to edit the file "in-place" (modifies the original file).
   * "s/<service-name>/$service_name/g" is the substitution command:
     * s/:  Indicates a substitution operation.
     * <service-name>: The target string to be replaced.  Make sure this exactly matches what's in your YAML file.
     * $service_name: The replacement string (the current service name from the loop).  The double quotes around $service_name are important to handle service names with spaces or special characters.
     * g:  Specifies that all occurrences of <service-name> on each line should be replaced (not just the first).
   * "$yaml_file": The name of the file to modify.
 * Echo Statements: The echo commands provide feedback about what the script is doing.
 * Finished Message: The final echo indicates the script has completed.
How to Use:
 * Save the script: Save the code above as a file (e.g., replace_service_names.sh).
 * Make it executable: chmod +x replace_service_names.sh
 * Run the script: ./replace_service_names.sh
Important Considerations:
 * Backup: It's highly recommended to create a backup of your a.yaml file before running the script, in case something goes wrong: cp a.yaml a.yaml.bak
 * Exact Match: The sed command relies on an exact match. If <service-name> has surrounding whitespace or is slightly different in your YAML file, the replacement might not work as expected.  Adjust the sed command accordingly.
 * YAML Structure: Be mindful of how the replacement affects the overall YAML structure. If <service-name> is part of a key or value that needs proper quoting, you might need to modify the script to handle that.  Using yq (a YAML processor) might be a better option for complex YAML manipulation.  If you provide an example of the relevant section of your a.yaml file, I can give more specific guidance.
 * Testing:  It's always a good idea to test the script on a copy of your YAML file first to ensure it works as intended.
If you have a more complex YAML structure or need more robust handling, using yq is generally recommended.  Provide a snippet of your YAML file, and I can help you write a yq-based script.
