Below is a concise documentation outline tailored for your task of collapsing repeatable code across GitOps repositories by extracting the rbac folder into a common catalog and handling the Asia cluster delta. This can be saved as a Markdown file (e.g., rbac-consolidation.md) or added to your team’s wiki.

RBAC Consolidation Across GitOps Repositories
Overview
This document outlines the process to eliminate repetitive rbac folder code across multiple GitOps repositories by consolidating it into a common catalog repository. It also addresses a small delta in the PowerUserClusterROLE for the Asia cluster using Kustomize patches.
Objective
	•	Reduce code duplication by extracting the rbac folder into a centralized repository.
	•	Ensure all clusters pull the same rbac configuration.
	•	Handle deviations (e.g., Asia cluster’s PowerUserClusterROLE ACLs) without disrupting operations.
Implementation Steps
1. Create Common Catalog Repository
	•	Repository: https://github.com/mfc-gwam-platops-common-manifests-k8s-catalog
	•	Action:
	◦	Extract the rbac folder from a standard cluster repository (e.g., US cluster) into the common catalog.
	◦	Commit and push to the main branch.
2. Update Cluster Repositories with Flux
	•	Tool: Flux (assumed based on “flux repos” mention)
	•	Action:
	◦	Remove the rbac folder from each cluster’s GitOps repository.
	◦	Add a GitRepository resource to point to the common catalog: apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
	◦	kind: GitRepository
	◦	metadata:
	◦	  name: common-catalog
	◦	  namespace: flux-system
	◦	spec:
	◦	  interval: 5m
	◦	  url: https://github.com/mfc-gwam-platops-common-manifests-k8s-catalog.git
	◦	  ref:
	◦	    branch: main
	◦	
	◦	Add a Kustomization resource to apply the rbac folder: apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
	◦	kind: Kustomization
	◦	metadata:
	◦	  name: cluster-rbac
	◦	  namespace: flux-system
	◦	spec:
	◦	  interval: 10m
	◦	  path: ./rbac
	◦	  prune: true
	◦	  sourceRef:
	◦	    kind: GitRepository
	◦	    name: common-catalog
	◦	
	◦	Commit and push changes to each cluster’s repository.
3. Handle Delta for Asia Cluster
	•	Delta: PowerUserClusterROLE in the Asia cluster has different ACLs.
	•	Action:
	◦	In the Asia cluster’s GitOps repository, create a kustomization.yaml: apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
	◦	kind: Kustomization
	◦	resources:
	◦	  - github.com/mfc-gwam-platops-common-manifests-k8s-catalog/rbac?ref=main
	◦	patches:
	◦	  - path: patches/poweruser-role-patch.yaml
	◦	    target:
	◦	      kind: Role
	◦	      name: PowerUserClusterROLE
	◦	
	◦	Create a patch file patches/poweruser-role-patch.yaml (example): apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
	◦	kind: Role
	◦	metadata:
	◦	  name: PowerUserClusterROLE
	◦	rules:
	◦	  - apiGroups: [""]
	◦	    resources: ["pods"]
	◦	    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete"] # Adjust based on actual delta
	◦	
	◦	Commit and push to the Asia cluster’s repository.
4. Validate and Deploy
	•	Testing:
	◦	Test in a staging cluster to ensure:
	▪	rbac is correctly pulled from the common catalog.
	▪	The Asia patch applies without issues.
	▪	No resources are disrupted (e.g., verify with prune: true).
	•	Deployment:
	◦	Roll out to production clusters one at a time (e.g., US first, then Asia).
	◦	Monitor with Kubernetes events or Prometheus to confirm no disruptions.
5. Verification
	•	Checks:
	◦	Confirm all clusters use the common rbac folder.
	◦	Validate PowerUserClusterROLE in the Asia cluster has the correct ACLs.
	•	Documentation Update:
	◦	Update team READMEs or wikis with the new structure.
Benefits
	•	Eliminates code duplication across repositories.
	•	Maintains consistency with a single source of truth.
	•	Handles cluster-specific deltas cleanly via Kustomize.

Notes
	•	Adjust the patch file content based on the exact delta in the Asia cluster’s PowerUserClusterROLE.
	•	Store this documentation in the common catalog repository or your team’s documentation system.
