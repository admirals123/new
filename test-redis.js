This year, I achieved my objectives by actively collaborating with Dev teams and colleagues to ensure seamless Tenantops migration and cluster upgrades, leveraging my expertise to enhance team capability and system stability. I proactively designed and externalized RBAC from each cluster region to avoid repetitive code, aligning with our innovation values and minimizing risks by improving efficiency and consistency. By facilitating knowledge transfer to Yvonne and Tiger and supporting regular work alongside migration efforts, I demonstrated risk awareness and fostered a culture of teamwork and open communication.
