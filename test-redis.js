The current production deadline is set for the end of September. However, I propose completing the project in advance. By working in teams and tailoring support to each teamâ€™s specific needs, we can distribute the workload effectively. This approach will prevent us from becoming overwhelmed toward the end, ensuring a smoother process and higher-quality output.
