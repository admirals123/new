Let's refine the NRQL query together.
Please provide more context:
 * Data source: Are you querying the SyntheticsCheckResult table?
 * Specific location: Do you want to filter the query to a particular private location?
 * Time range: Are you looking for data within a specific timeframe?
 * Aggregation: Do you need to aggregate the queue size (e.g., average, maximum, minimum) over a period?
Here's a revised query based on common assumptions:
SELECT private_location_name, AVG(queue_size) AS average_queue_size, MIN(queue_size) AS minimum_queue_size, MAX(queue_size) AS maximum_queue_size
FROM SyntheticsCheckResult
WHERE private_location_name IS NOT NULL
[OPTIONAL: WHERE timestamp >= '2024-10-01' AND timestamp <= '2024-10-04']
GROUP BY private_location_name

Explanation:
 * private_location_name: Selects the name of the private location.
 * AVG(queue_size): Calculates the average queue size for each location.
 * MIN(queue_size): Finds the minimum queue size for each location.
 * MAX(queue_size): Finds the maximum queue size for each location.
 * WHERE clause: Optionally filters the results by timestamp to a specific range.
Please replace the placeholder timestamp values with your desired start and end dates.
If you have a more specific requirement, feel free to share it, and I'll adjust the query accordingly.
