This year, I'll focus on showing how advanced Kubernetes features can make our applications better and more valuable to the business. I'll work with the team to measure things like faster performance and lower costs, and explain how these improvements directly help the company. This means understanding how our work impacts the business and finding ways to use Kubernetes to make things even better.
