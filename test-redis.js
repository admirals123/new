There could be a few reasons why the Java worker process is failing on AKS while working fine in your local Docker container. Here are some areas to investigate:
 * Java Runtime Environment: Ensure the Java runtime environment (JRE) on your AKS cluster is compatible with the Java version your code uses. AKS offers various node pool images, so you might need to adjust your cluster configuration.
 * Missing Libraries: Verify that all the Java libraries your code depends on are present in the AKS environment. You might need to create a Docker image that includes these libraries and deploy that image to AKS.
 * Configuration Differences: Double-check if there are any configuration differences between your local Docker setup and AKS. This could involve environment variables, application settings, or even web server configurations.
 * Resource Constraints: Consider resource limitations on AKS compared to your local environment. If your worker process is resource-intensive, you might need to allocate more resources to the pods in AKS.
By systematically checking these areas, you should be able to identify the root cause of the issue and get your Java worker process running smoothly on AKS.





Sure, here is a way to paraphrase the text in the image completely differently:
 * I sought out my team's help to better understand my weaknesses and continuously learn. I met with colleagues regularly to get their insights. I leveraged my cloud expertise to contribute to the GWAM project. I offered assistance to GWAM team members whenever possible and shared relevant knowledge.


Collaborated with colleagues to gain knowledge of Azure concepts and Terraform.
