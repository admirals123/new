Based on your clarification that you haven’t used patches and have instead relied on Kustomization based on region and retirement (likely meaning “environment” or specific cluster contexts like asia-rtm), I’ll adjust the documentation to reflect this. The focus will remain on the region-specific Kustomization setup without mentioning patches, and I’ll refine the language to align with your current implementation.

RBAC Consolidation Across GitOps Repositories
Overview
This document describes the process of consolidating the rbac folder across multiple GitOps repositories into a common catalog repository (common-manifests-k8s-catalog). The structure includes region-specific subfolders (region-na for North America clusters including CA and US, and region-asia with asia and asia-rtm subfolders) to manage cluster-specific configurations based on region and environment.
Objective
	•	Eliminate code duplication by centralizing the rbac folder in a common repository.
	•	Organize configurations by region (NA for CA and US clusters, Asia for asia and asia-rtm environments).
	•	Ensure all clusters pull the appropriate rbac configuration using region- and environment-specific Kustomizations.
Implementation Steps
1. Common Catalog Repository Structure
	•	Repository: https://github.com/mfc-gwam-platops-common-manifests-k8s-catalog
	•	Structure:
	◦	rbac/
	▪	common/: Shared RBAC configurations applicable to all clusters.
	▪	nonprod/: RBAC configurations for non-production environments (if applicable).
	▪	prod/: RBAC configurations for production environments (if applicable).
	▪	region-na/: RBAC configurations for North America clusters (CA and US).
	▪	region-asia/
	▪	asia/: RBAC configurations for the Asia cluster.
	▪	asia-rtm/: RBAC configurations for the Asia RTM environment (e.g., retirement or a specific variant).
	•	Action:
	◦	Extract the rbac folder from existing cluster repositories and organize it into the above structure.
	◦	Commit and push to the main branch.
	◦	Update CODEOWNERS, pull_request_template.md, and README.md to reflect ownership and contribution guidelines.
2. Update Cluster Repositories with Flux
	•	Tool: Flux (assumed based on “flux repos” mention)
	•	Action:
	◦	Remove the rbac folder from each cluster’s GitOps repository.
	◦	Add a GitRepository resource to point to the common catalog: apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
	◦	kind: GitRepository
	◦	metadata:
	◦	  name: common-catalog
	◦	  namespace: flux-system
	◦	spec:
	◦	  interval: 5m
	◦	  url: https://github.com/mfc-gwam-platops-common-manifests-k8s-catalog.git
	◦	  ref:
	◦	    branch: main
	◦	
	◦	Add a Kustomization resource tailored to each cluster’s region and environment:
	▪	For NA clusters (CA and US): apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
	▪	kind: Kustomization
	▪	metadata:
	▪	  name: cluster-rbac-na
	▪	  namespace: flux-system
	▪	spec:
	▪	  interval: 10m
	▪	  path: ./rbac/region-na
	▪	  prune: true
	▪	  sourceRef:
	▪	    kind: GitRepository
	▪	    name: common-catalog
	▪	
	▪	For Asia cluster: apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
	▪	kind: Kustomization
	▪	metadata:
	▪	  name: cluster-rbac-asia
	▪	  namespace: flux-system
	▪	spec:
	▪	  interval: 10m
	▪	  path: ./rbac/region-asia/asia
	▪	  prune: true
	▪	  sourceRef:
	▪	    kind: GitRepository
	▪	    name: common-catalog
	▪	
	▪	For Asia RTM environment: apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
	▪	kind: Kustomization
	▪	metadata:
	▪	  name: cluster-rbac-asia-rtm
	▪	  namespace: flux-system
	▪	spec:
	▪	  interval: 10m
	▪	  path: ./rbac/region-asia/asia-rtm
	▪	  prune: true
	▪	  sourceRef:
	▪	    kind: GitRepository
	▪	    name: common-catalog
	▪	
	◦	Commit and push changes to each cluster’s repository.
	◦	Flux will apply the appropriate rbac configuration based on the path specified for each region and environment.
3. Validate and Deploy
	•	Testing:
	◦	Test in a staging cluster to ensure:
	▪	The correct rbac subfolder (e.g., region-na, region-asia/asia, or region-asia/asia-rtm) is applied.
	▪	No resources are disrupted (verify with prune: true).
	•	Deployment:
	◦	Roll out to production clusters one at a time (e.g., NA clusters first, then Asia and Asia RTM).
	◦	Monitor with Kubernetes events or Prometheus to confirm no disruptions.
4. Verification
	•	Checks:
	◦	Confirm NA clusters (CA and US) use rbac/region-na.
	◦	Confirm Asia cluster uses rbac/region-asia/asia.
	◦	Confirm Asia RTM environment uses rbac/region-asia/asia-rtm (if applicable).
	•	Documentation Update:
	◦	Update team READMEs or wikis with the new structure.
Benefits
	•	Eliminates code duplication by centralizing rbac configurations.
	•	Supports region- and environment-specific configurations with a clear folder structure.
	•	Simplifies management using Flux Kustomizations.

Notes
	•	The region-na folder serves as the common configuration for CA and US clusters. Adjust its contents to reflect shared settings.
	•	The region-asia folder includes asia for the main Asia cluster and asia-rtm for the RTM environment (e.g., retirement or a specific variant). Ensure each subfolder contains the appropriate configuration.
	•	Store this documentation in the common-manifests-k8s-catalog repository (e.g., as README.md or rbac-consolidation.md).

Changes Made
	1	Removed the “Optional: Handle Delta for Asia Cluster” section since you’re not using patches.
	2	Adjusted the focus to emphasize region- and environment-specific Kustomizations (e.g., region-na, region-asia/asia, and region-asia/asia-rtm).
	3	Clarified that asia-rtm is treated as an environment variant (e.g., retirement), aligning with your mention of “retirement.”
	4	Streamlined the document to reflect your current implementation without patches.
Let me know if you need further tweaks!
