Explanation:
 * Import necessary modules: (If not already imported)
   * os: For file system operations (optional, depending on your use case)
 * Define the function create_new_file():
   * Takes four arguments:
     * file1: Path to the input file.
     * file2: Path to the output file.
     * file3: Path to the file containing the desired output format.
     * value_to_grab: The specific value to extract from file1.
 * Read the input file (file1) using with open(...) as f1::
   * Read the entire content of file1 into the file1_content variable.
 * Extract the desired value:
   * Check if value_to_grab exists in file1_content.
   * If found, extract the value after value_to_grab (assuming a simple scenario).
     * This assumes a specific format where the value follows value_to_grab and is the first word after it. You might need to adjust this based on the actual format of file1.
   * If value_to_grab is not found, raise a ValueError.
 * Read the format file (file3) using with open(...) as f3::
   * Read the entire content of file3 into the file3_content variable.
 * Create the content for the new file (file2) by replacing a placeholder (e.g., {{value}}) in file3_content with the extracted_value.
 * Write the new content to the output file (file2) using with open(...) as f2::
   * Write the new_file2_content to file2.
 * Print a success message.
 * Handle potential errors:
   * FileNotFoundError: Raised if any of the input files (file1, file3) are not found.
   * ValueError: Raised if the value_to_grab is not found in file1.
 * Example usage:
 * Provide sample values for file1_path, file2_path, file3_path, and value_to_find.
 * Call the create_new_file() function with the provided arguments.
Note:
 * This script provides a basic example. You may need to modify it based on the specific formats of your input files (file1, file3) and the logic for extracting the desired value from file1.
 * Consider using regular expressions for more robust value extraction, especially if the format of file1 is complex.
 * Add error handling and logging for better debugging and monitoring.
 * This script assumes that file3 contains a placeholder (e.g., {{value}}) to be replaced with the extracted value. You can adjust this placeholder or the replacement logic as needed.
