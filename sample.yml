Subject: Request for LMIA Application Assistance

Dear [HR Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss the possibility of our company, Manulife, providing an LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment) for my current employment situation.

As you may be aware, an LMIA is a crucial document required for certain immigration processes, including work permit applications. Given my role within the company and the potential benefits to both myself and Manulife, I believe obtaining an LMIA could greatly facilitate my continued employment here.

I have thoroughly researched the requirements and processes involved in obtaining an LMIA, and I am prepared to provide any necessary documentation or information to support the application process. Additionally, I am more than willing to work closely with the HR department and any other relevant stakeholders to ensure a smooth and efficient application process.

I understand that this request may require careful consideration and coordination, and I am available to discuss any questions or concerns you may have. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated, and I am confident that obtaining an LMIA would be mutually beneficial for both parties.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and the opportunity to further discuss how we can proceed with this request.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
