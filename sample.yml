Subject: Request for Information Regarding LMIA Process

Dear [HR Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment) process and the support that Manulife provides in obtaining LMIA for employees.

As I am considering certain opportunities within the company that may require LMIA sponsorship, I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with information regarding:

1. The company's policy and process for sponsoring LMIA for employees.
2. Any resources or assistance available to employees in navigating the LMIA application process.
3. Any specific requirements or criteria for employees seeking LMIA sponsorship.

Understanding these aspects would greatly assist me in making informed decisions regarding my career path within the organization.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
